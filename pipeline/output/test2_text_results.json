It is powered by state-of-the-art specialized AI models for layout analysis (DocLayNet) and table structure recognition (TableFormer), and runs efficiently on commodity hardware in a small resource budget. Docling is released as a Python package and can be used as a Python API or as a CLI tool. Docling’s modular architecture and efficient document representation make it easy to implement extensions, new features, models, and customizations. Docling has been already integrated in other popular open-source frameworks (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, spaCy), making it a natural fit for the processing of documents and the development of high-end applications. The open-source community has fully engaged in using, promoting, and developing for Docling, which gathered 10k stars on GitHub in less than a month and was reported as the No. 1 trending repository in GitHub worldwide in November 2024."

With the advent of LLMs and popular application patterns such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), leveraging the rich content embedded in PDFs, Office documents, and scanned document images has become ever more relevant. In the past decade, several powerful document understanding solutions have emerged on the market, most of which are commercial software, SaaS offerings on hyperscalers (Auer et al. 2022) and most recently, multimodal vision-language models. Typically, they incur a cost (e.g., for licensing or LLM inference) and cannot be run easily on local hardware. Meanwhile, only a handful of different open-source tools cover PDF, MS Word, MS PowerPoint, Images, or HTML conversion, leaving a significant feature and quality gap to proprietary solutions."

Docling is designed as a simple, self-contained Python library with permissive MIT license, running entirely locally on commodity hardware. Its code architecture allows for easy extensibility and addition of new features and models. Since its launch in July 2024, Docling has attracted considerable attention in the AI developer community and ranks top on GitHub’s monthly trending repositories with more than 10, 000 stars at the time of writing. On October 16, 2024, Docling reached a major milestone with version 2, introducing several new features and concepts, which we outline in this updated technical report, along with details on its architecture, conversion speed benchmarks, and comparisons to other open-source assets."

Among proprietary solutions, prominent examples include GPT-4o (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), and Gemini (Google). In the open-source domain, LLaVA-based models, such as LLaVA-next, are noteworthy. However, all generative AI-based models face two significant challenges. First, they are prone to hallucinations, i.e., their output may contain false information which is not present in the source document -- a critical issue when faithful transcription of document content is required. Second, these models demand substantial computational resources, making the conversion process expensive. Consequently, VLM-based tools are typically offered as SaaS, with compute-intensive operations performed remotely in the cloud."

Docling falls into this category, leveraging modular, task-specific models which recover document structures and features only. All text content is taken from the programmatic PDF or transcribed through OCR methods. This design ensures faithful conversion, without the risk of generating false content. However, it necessitates maintaining a diverse set of models for different document components, such as formulas or figures."

It can predict the logical row and column structure of a given table based on an input image, and determine which table cells belong to column headers, row headers or the table body. Compared to earlier approaches, Table- Former handles many characteristics of tables like partial or no borderlines, empty cells, rows or columns, cell spans and hierarchy on both column-heading and row-heading level, tables with inconsistent indentation or alignment and other complexities. For inference, our implementation relies on PyTorch (Ansel et al. 2024). The PDF pipeline feeds all table objects detected in the layout analysis to the TableFormer model, by providing an image-crop of the table and the included text cells. TableFormer structure predictions are matched back to the PDF cells during a post-processing step, to avoid expensive re-transcription of the table image-crop, which also makes the TableFormer model language agnostic."

The former provides a simple starting point, upon which any text-based chunking method may be applied (e.g., also drawing from the framework library), while the latter, which uses a swappable Docling chunker type, can be the more powerful one, as it can provide document-native RAG grounding via rich metadata such as the page number and the bounding box of the supporting context. For usage outside of these frameworks, users can still employ Docling chunkers to accelerate and simplify the development of their custom pipelines. Besides strict RAG pipelines for Q&A, Docling can naturally be utilized in the context of broader agentic workflows for which it can provide document-based knowledge for agents to decide and act on."
